    "### Categories \n",
    "\n",
    "At the most fundamental level, machine learning can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supervised learning* involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some label associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data.\n",
    "This is further subdivided into *classification* tasks and *regression* tasks: in classification, the labels are discrete categories, while in regression, the labels are continuous quantities.\n",
    "We will see examples of both types of supervised learning in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Unsupervised learning* involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label, and is often described as \"letting the dataset speak for itself.\"\n",
    "These models include tasks such as *clustering* and *dimensionality reduction.*\n",
    "Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of data, while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data.\n",
    "We will see examples of both types of unsupervised learning in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are so-called *semi-supervised learning* methods, which falls somewhere between supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning methods are often useful when only incomplete labels are available."

    "Here we have two-dimensional data: that is, we have two features for each point, represented by the (x,y) positions of the points on the plane. In addition, we have one of two class labels for each point, here represented by the colors of the points. From these features and labels, we would like to create a model that will let us decide whether a new point should be labeled \"blue\" or \"red.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of possible models for such a classification task, but here we will use an extremely simple one. We will make the assumption that the two groups can be separated by drawing a straight line through the plane between them, such that points on each side of the line fall in the same group. Here the model is a quantitative version of the statement \"a straight line separates the classes\", while the model parameters are the particular numbers describing the location and orientation of that line for our data. The optimal values for these model parameters are learned from the data (this is the \"learning\" in machine learning), which is often called training the model."

    "\n",
    "In contrast with the discrete labels of a classification algorithm, we will next look at a simple *regression* task in which the labels are continuous quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the classification example, we have two-dimensional data: that is, there are two features describing each data point. The color of each point represents the continuous label for that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of possible regression models we might use for this type of data, but we can use a simple linear regression to predict the points. This simple linear regression model assumes that if we treat the label as a third spatial dimension, we can fit a plane to the data. This is a higher-level generalization of the well-known problem of fitting a line to data with two coordinates.\n",
    "As with the classification example, this may seem rather trivial in a low number of dimensions. But the power of these methods is that they can be straightforwardly applied and evaluated in the case of data with many, many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this is similar to the task of computing the distance to galaxies observed through a telescope—in this case, we might use the following features and labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "feature 1, feature 2, etc.  →→  brightness of each galaxy at one of several wave lengths or colors\n",
    "label  →→  distance or redshift of the galaxy\n",
    "The distances for a small number of these galaxies might be determined through an independent set of (typically more expensive) observations. Distances to remaining galaxies could then be estimated using a suitable regression model, without the need to employ the more expensive observation across the entire set. In astronomy circles, this is known as the \"photometric redshift\" problem.\n"

    "One common case of unsupervised learning is \"clustering,\" in which data is automatically assigned to some number of discrete groups.\n",
    "Given this input, a clustering model will use the intrinsic structure of the data (i.e. distance between points) to determine which points are related. For instance, k-means clustering algorithm fits a model consisting of k cluster centers; the optimal centers are assumed to be those that minimize the distance of each point from its assigned center. Again, this might seem like a trivial exercise in two dimensions, but as our data becomes larger and more complex, such clustering algorithms can be employed to extract useful information from the dataset."
