    "These methods are a powerful classification method for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their dependence on relatively few support vectors means that they are very compact models, and take up very little memory.\n",
    "- Once the model is trained, the prediction phase is very fast.\n",
    "- Because they are affected only by points near the margin, they work well with high-dimensional data—even data with more dimensions than samples, which is a challenging regime for other algorithms.\n",
    "- Their integration with kernel methods makes them very versatile, able to adapt to many types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SVMs have several disadvantages as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scaling with the number of samples $N$ is $\\mathcal{O}[N^3]$ at worst, or $\\mathcal{O}[N^2]$ for efficient implementations. For large numbers of training samples, this computational cost can be prohibitive.\n",
    "- The results are strongly dependent on a suitable choice for the softening parameter $C$. This must be carefully chosen via cross-validation, which can be expensive as datasets grow in size.\n",
    "- The results do not have a direct probabilistic interpretation. This can be estimated via an internal cross-validation (see the ``probability`` parameter of ``SVC``), but this extra estimation is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With those traits in mind, I generally only turn to SVMs once other simpler, faster, and less tuning-intensive methods have been shown to be insufficient for my needs.\n",
    "Nevertheless, if you have the CPU cycles to commit to training and cross-validating an SVM on your data, the method can lead to excellent results."
